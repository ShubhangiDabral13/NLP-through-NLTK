## lemmatizing with NLTK
A very similar operation to stemming is called lemmatizing. The major difference between these is, as you saw earlier, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words.

So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma.
